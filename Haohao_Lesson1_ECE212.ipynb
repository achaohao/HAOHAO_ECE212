Also it is said in understanding computer programs i must acquire algorithmic and mechanistic thinking. Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed, they transform input data into output data. They execute very reliably, and very fast, but not creatively. Computers do what you tell them to do, not what you mean for them to do. Thus,understanding computer code involves a lot of mental simulation of what will actually happen, not what you wish would happen. Moreover, it does not only require mechanistic thinking but also creative problem solving. \n   I must say, I don't really have that vast idea about Phyton and also I have very few knowledge about computer programs, computer language and coding so I really hope I will learn more about all of about phyton, programming, coding etc.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Activity"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.

Also, if talking about today and the world's future,  i think those who understand computer programs will mostly to have their jobs sustained because I think most factory workers and even taxi drivers will lose their job due to the fact that most equipment and cars will eventually run by their own in the future, of course accomodated by computer programs. \n2.

My primary motivation is the prediction that all equipments in the future will now be run by itself, processing computer langauge and it will not need a human to operate it anymore.I would be setting my mindset that the world's future will be filled with technology's everywhere and that those people who knew how to code are most likely to have a greater career in the future."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Abstraction"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1. The Phyton Programming Language"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"   What I learned in this part based on the module description of this is that Python is an example of a highlevel language C++, ++PHP, and Java. These types of computer language is more complicated than those lowlevel language because unlike low level computer language, these highlevel language must be processed first before it can run. However, the advantages of using this type of language is that first, it is time-saving and second, they are portable. Unlike lowlevel language that requires only 3-step process, these highlevel language uses 5-step process like souce code, compiler, object code, executor, and output. A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. Basic instructions like input, output, math and logic, conditional execution and repetition also appear in this type of language. I also learned that programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations and has very strict rules about syntax. Syntax which rules to come in two flavors, pertaining to tokens and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements while structure of a statement— that is, the way the tokens are arranged. Lastly, this formal language differs in natural languages not just in tokens, structure, syntax, and semantics but also in ambiguity, redundancy, literalness, poetry and program.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Application"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Ask\tyourself:"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. Why\tdo\t you\t think\tPython\tis\t the\tmost\tapplicable\tprogramming\tlanguage\t for\tscientific\tcomputing?\n    * I think Phyton is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing because it is one of the most commonly used computer language. It is time-saving because it is a highlevel computer language. It is portable. It is much more easy to use than lowlevel language programs and also it can create more complicated programs that a computer can run. Other advantages of using Phyton is that it reduces maintenance cost, it is asynchronous coding and has wide applicability.\n    \n2.
