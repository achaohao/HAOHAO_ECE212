    "    I've learned the basic building blocks of phyton proggramming in coursera; from the type of data like list, integer, variable, string, character etc. Then after that, they've introduce to us the operations and how it works, the sequence of computing when your using multiple operations and such. later on, we learned the function calling, the introduction of data in a single coding and using function call to to operate it. \n",
    "    It was all so very informative, like the step by step codings, how the computer reads it, how it function, the differences of the ouput if you combine an integer and a character in a single operation, how the operation works and everything about the most basic building character of the phyton programmming. I actually had a lot of fun doing the exercises and activities in the runestone book and the videos they prepare are really clear and a lot less or not confusing. "
